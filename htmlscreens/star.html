	<h1> Star </h1>
		<p>
			A star is a massive, luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. 
		The nearest star to Earth is the Sun, which is the source of most of the planet's
		energy. Some other stars are visible from Earth during the night, appearing as a 
		multitude of fixed luminous points due to their immense distance. Historically, 
		the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, and the 
		brightest stars gained proper names. Extensive catalogues of stars have been 
		assembled by astronomers, which provide standardized star designations.
		For at least a portion of its life, a star shines due to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen
		into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then
		radiates into outer space. Once the hydrogen in the core of a star is nearly exhausted, 
		almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar 
		nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime and, for some stars, by supernova nucleosynthesis
		when it explodes. Near the end of its life, a star can also contain degenerate matter. 
		Astronomers can determine the mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other
		properties of a star by observing its motion through space, luminosity, and spectrum respectively. 
		The total mass of a star is the principal determinant of its evolution and eventual fate. Other 
		characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature change over its life, while the
		star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars 
		against their luminosities, known as a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (H-R diagram), allows the
		age and evolutionary state of a star to be determined. <br/>  </br>
			A star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material composed
		primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements. Once the stellar
		core is sufficiently dense, hydrogen becomes steadily converted into helium through nuclear fusion,
		releasing energy in the process. The remainder of the star's interior carries energy away from 
		the core through a combination of radiative and convective processes. The star's internal pressure
		prevents it from collapsing further under its own gravity. Once the hydrogen fuel at the core is 
		exhausted, a star with at least 0.4 times the mass of the Sun expands to become a red giant, in 
		some cases fusing heavier elements at the core or in shells around the core. The star then evolves 
		into a degenerate form, recycling a portion of its matter into the interstellar environment, where 
		it will contribute to the formation of a new generation of stars with a higher proportion of heavy 
		elements.Meanwhile, the core becomes a stellar remnant: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or 
		(if it is sufficiently massive) a black hole. Binary and multi-star systems consist of two or more
		stars that are gravitationally bound, and generally move around each other in stable orbits. When
		two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can have a significant
		impact on their evolution.[4] Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure,
		such as a star cluster or a galaxy.

	<h1> Observation History </h1>
		<p>
		Historically, stars have been important to civilizations throughout the world. They have been part
		of religious practices and used for celestial navigation and orientation. Many ancient astronomers
		believed that stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere, and that they were immutable. 
		By convention, astronomers grouped stars into constellations and used them to track the motions of
		the planets and the inferred position of the Sun. The motion of the Sun against the background 
		stars (and the horizon) was used to create calendars, which could be used to regulate agricultural
		practices. The Gregorian calendar, currently used nearly everywhere in the world, is a solar 
		calendar based on the angle of the Earth's rotational axis relative to its local star, the Sun.
		The oldest accurately dated star chart appeared in ancient Egyptian astronomy in 1534 BC. The earliest 
		known star catalogues were compiled by the ancient Babylonian astronomers of Mesopotamia in the 
		late 2nd millennium BC, during the Kassite Period (ca. 1531-1155 BC).
		The first star catalogue in Greek astronomy was created by Aristillus in approximately 300 BC, 
		with the help of Timocharis. The star catalog of Hipparchus (2nd century BC) included 1020 
		stars and was used to assemble Ptolemy's star catalogue. Hipparchus is known for the discovery
		of the first recorded nova (new star).  </br> </br> Many of the constellations and star names in use today 
		derive from Greek astronomy.
		In spite of the apparent immutability of the heavens, Chinese astronomers were aware that new
		stars could appear. In 185 AD, they were the first to observe and write about a supernova,
		now known as the SN 185. The brightest stellar event in recorded history was the SN 1006 
		supernova, which was observed in 1006 and written about by the Egyptian astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan 
		and several Chinese astronomers. The SN 1054 supernova, which gave birth to the Crab Nebula,
		was also observed by Chinese and Islamic astronomers.
		Medieval Islamic astronomers gave Arabic names to many stars that are still used today, and they
		invented numerous astronomical instruments that could compute the positions of the stars. They
		built the first large observatory research institutes, mainly for the purpose of producing Zij 
		star catalogues. Among these, the Book of Fixed Stars (964) was written by the Persian astronomer
		Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, who observed a number of stars, star clusters (including the Omicron Velorum 
		and Brocchi's Clusters) and galaxies (including the Andromeda Galaxy). According to A. Zahoor, 
		in the 11th century, the Persian polymath scholar Abu Rayhan Biruni described the Milky Way galaxy 
		as a multitude of fragments having the properties of nebulous stars, and also gave the latitudes 
		of various stars during a lunar eclipse in 1019.
