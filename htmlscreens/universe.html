	<h1> History of Dance </h1>
	<p>
		Archeological evidence for early dance includes 9,000 year old paintings in India at the Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka, and Egyptian tomb paintings depicting dancing figures, dated c. 3300 BC.<br></br>
Before the invention of written languages, dance was a more important method of passing stories down from generation to generation. The use of dance in ecstatic trance states and healing rituals, as today in many cultures from the Brazilian rainforest to the Kalahari Desert, is thought to have been another early factor.<br></br>
Greek dance (horos) is referred to by Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch and Lucian.<br></br>
The Bible and Talmud refer to many events related to dance, and contain over 30 different dance terms.<br></br>
In Chinese pottery as early as the Neolithic period groups of people are depicted dancing in a line holding hands. The earliest Chinese word for "dance" is found written in the oracle bones. Dance is described in the LÃ¼shi Chunqiu. Primitive dance in ancient China was associated with sorcery and shamanic rituals.<br></br>
During the first millennium BCE in India, many texts were composed which attempted to codify aspects of daily life. Bharata Muni's Natyashastra (literally "the text of dramaturgy") is one of the earlier texts. It mainly deals with drama, in which dance plays an important part in Indian culture. It categorises dance into four types - secular, ritual, abstract, and, interpretive - and into four regional varieties. The text elaborates various hand-gestures (mudras) and classifies movements of the various limbs, steps and so on. From these beginnings rose the various classical styles recognised today.<br></br>
Many contemporary dance forms can be traced back to historical, traditional, ceremonial, and ethnic dance.
